I am a PhD candidate at HelmholtzAI in Munich, under the supervision of [Niki Kilbertus](https://nikikilbertus.info). \
\
Industry experience taught me that machine learning algorithms are still lacking acceptance and fail to provide much desired explanations. My research concentrates on bringing a causal view point to machine learning. More precisely, those interests include questions around cause-effect estimation, how experiments can help to inform our algorithms and how the definition of causality might bring us closer to a proper understanding of the world.
