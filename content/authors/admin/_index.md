I am a PhD candidate at HelmholtzAI in Munich, under the supervision of Niki Kilbertus. \

Formerly working in the industry, I felt that machine learning is still missing \*something\*. My motivation stems from bringing a causal view point to machine learning in general. More precisely, my research interests include questions around cause-effect estimation, but also how experiments can help to inform our algorithms and how the definition of causality might bring us closer to a proper understanding of the world.In my freetime, I enjoy falling of the grid, most likely then being bike-packing in the mountains.
