abstract: Many scientific datasets are compositional in nature. Important
  examples include species abundances in ecology, rock compositions in geology,
  topic compositions in large-scale text corpora, and sequencing count data in
  molecular biology. Here, we provide a causal view on compositional data in an
  instrumental variable setting where the composition acts as the cause. First,
  we crisply articulate potential pitfalls for practitioners regarding the
  interpretation of compositional causes from the viewpoint of interventions and
  warn against attributing causal meaning to common summary statistics such as
  diversity indices. We then advocate for and develop multivariate methods using
  statistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the
  special structure of the compositional sample space into account. In a
  comparative analysis on synthetic and real data we show the advantages and
  limitations of our proposal. We posit that our framework provides a useful
  starting point and guidance for valid and informative cause-effect estimation
  in the context of compositional data.
